Full Page Screen Capture
========================

A simple Google Chrome extension that takes a screen capture of a full web page. Every extension I tried couldn't do this on Chrome 22 on Mac OSX Lion. So, I built this one to reliably do it. (Not tested, yet, on any other configurations.)

To Install

1. [Download the extension](http://gleitzman.com/media/misc/full-page-screen-capture.crx)
2. Click the wrench icon on the Chrome browser toolbar
3. Select Tools > Extensions
4. Locate the "crx" extension file on your computer - drag and drop the file onto the Extensions page.
5. Review the list of permissions in the dialog that appears. If you would like to proceed, click Install.

Extra notes:

*   Don't move your mouse around during the screen capture, it will cause the scroll bar to appear!
*   After intalling, you'll probably have to refresh the current tab or open a new one to immediately use the extension.
